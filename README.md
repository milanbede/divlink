# Bible Terminal

A terminal-style web application for querying Bible passages using an LLM.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement soft throttling for API requests.
- [ ] Improve model selection (e.g., allow user choice or dynamic selection based on query).
- [ ] Add caching for LLM responses and/or Bible passages to reduce API calls and improve speed.
- [ ] Implement username Easter Eggs for a bit of fun.
